# Get your Google Analytics Tracking Id

Follow the instructions in [this page](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2614741) to set up and get the tracking ID for a new app property in either a new or existing Google Analytics account.

# iOS Getting Started

There are two steps to getting started with the iOS SDK:

1. Initialize the tracker
2. Add screen measurement

After completing these steps, you'll be able to measure the following with Google Analytics:

* App installations
* Active users and demographics
* Screens and user engagement
* Crashes and exceptions

## Initializing the tracker

To initialize the tracker, use the `GoogleAnalytics.iOS` namespace in your AppDelegate and add this code to your AppDelegate's `FinishedLaunching` method:

```csharp
using GoogleAnalytics.iOS;
//...

// Shared GA tracker
public IGAITracker Tracker;

// Learn how to get your own Tracking Id from:
// https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2614741?hl=en
public static readonly string TrackingId = "UA-TRACKING-ID";

public override bool FinishedLaunching (UIApplication app, NSDictionary options)
{

	// Optional: set Google Analytics dispatch interval to e.g. 20 seconds.
	GAI.SharedInstance.DispatchInterval = 20;
	
	// Optional: automatically send uncaught exceptions to Google Analytics.
	GAI.SharedInstance.TrackUncaughtExceptions = true;
	
	// Initialize tracker.
	Tracker = GAI.SharedInstance.GetTracker (TrackingId);
}
```

**Note**: When you obtain a tracker for a given tracking Id, the tracker instance is persisted in the library. When you call `GetTracker` with the same tracking Id later, the same tracker instance will be returned. Also, the Google Analytics SDK exposes a default tracker instance that gets set to the first tracker instance created. It can be accessed by:

```csharp
GAI.SharedInstance.DefaultTracker
```

Note that in the above example, "UA-TRACKING-ID" here is a placeholder for the tracking ID assigned to you when you created your Google Analytics property. If you are only using one property ID in your app, using the default tracker method is best.

## Implementing screen measurement

To implement it you must provide the view name to be used in your Google Analytics reports. A good place to put this is the view controller's initializer method, if you have one, or the `ViewDidAppear` method:

```csharp
using GoogleAnalytics.iOS;
//...

public override void ViewDidAppear (bool animated)
{
	base.ViewDidAppear (animated);
	
	// This screen name value will remain set on the tracker and sent with
	// hits until it is set to a new value or to null.
	GAI.SharedInstance.DefaultTracker.Set (GAIConstants.ScreenName, "Main View");

	GAI.SharedInstance.DefaultTracker.Send (GAIDictionaryBuilder.CreateAppView ().Build ());
}
```

**Note**: `GAIConstants` is a static class containing all the constants you can set in the `Set` method from the `GAIDictionaryBuilder` class.

Congratulations! Your Xamarin.iOS app is now setup to send data to Google Analytics.
